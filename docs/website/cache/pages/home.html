<p>This is a companion site for the python package <strong>pyphs</strong>, which is dedicated to the treatment of passive multiphysical systems in the Port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS) formalism. This formalism structures physical systems into
— energy conserving parts,
— power dissipating parts and
— source parts.
This guarantees a power balance is fulfilled, including for numerical simulations based on an adapted numerical method.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Systems are described by directed multi-graphs (networkx.MultiDiGraph).</li>
<li>The time-continuous port-Hamiltonian structure is build from an automated graph analysis.</li>
<li>The discrete-time port-Hamiltonian structure is derived from a structure preserving numerical method.</li>
<li><strong>LaTeX</strong> description code and <strong>C++</strong> simulation code are automatically generated.</li>
