This is a companion site for the python package `PyPHS <https://github.com/afalaize/pyphs/>`__, developped in the `project/team S3 <http://s3.ircam.fr/?lang=en>`__ (Sound Signals and Systems) at `STMS Research Lab <http://www.ircam.fr/recherche/lunite-mixte-de-recherche-stms/>`__ (CNRS UMR 9912), hosted by `IRCAM <http://www.ircam.fr/>`__. 

This software was initially developed between 2012 and 2016 as a part of the PhD project of `Antoine Falaize <https://afalaize.github.io/>`__, under the direction of `Thomas HÃ©lie <http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/helie/>`__, and through a funding from French doctoral school `EDITE <http://edite-de-paris.fr/spip/>`__ (UPMC ED-130).

----------

This software is dedicated to the treatment of passive multiphysical systems in the Port-Hamiltonian Systems (PHS) formalism.

This formalism structures physical systems into

* energy conserving parts,
* power dissipating parts and
* source parts.

This guarantees a power balance is fulfilled, including for simulations based on an adapted numerical method.

Introduction
--------------

1. Systems are described by directed multi-graphs.

2. The time-continuous port-Hamiltonian structure is build from an automated graph analysis.

3. The discrete-time port-Hamiltonian structure is derived from a structure preserving numerical method.

4. **LaTeX** description code and **C++** simulation code are automatically generated.

Example
--------------

Consider the following serial resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) electronic circuit:

.. image:: /figures/RLC.jpg

1. Define the Netlist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Put the following content in a text file with **.net** extension, (here *rlc_netlist.net*):

.. line-block::

	electronics.source out ('ref', 'A'): type='voltage';
	electronics.resistor R1 ('A', 'B'): R=1e3;
	electronics.inductor L1 ('B', 'C'): L=0.05;
	electronics.capacitor C1 ('C', 'ref'): C=2e-06;

2. Perform graph analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following python code from the netlist file directory:

.. code:: python

  import pyphs
  rlc = pyphs.PortHamiltonianObject(label='rlc', path='rlc')
  rlc.build_from_netlist('rlc_netlist.net')

3. Export **LaTeX**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

	rlc.texwrite()

4. Export **C++**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

	rlc.cppbuild()
	rlc.cppwrite()
