My name is Antoine Falaize. I am a father, a researcher and a musician (order matters!).

I currently hold a postdoctoral position at the french Laboratory of Engineering Sciences for Environment (LaSIE, UMR CNRS 7356, University of la Rochelle, France). This work is about model order reduction in computational fluid dynamics.

Background
-----------
I received the second-year university level in Vibration, Acoustic and Signal Pocessing from the Laboratory for Acoustics at University of Maine (LAUM, UMR CNRS 6613, Le Mans, France) in 2006, before an experience as a music producer and sound engineer. Then I received the M.S. degree in Acoustic and Signal Processing Applied to Music in 2012 from the University *Pierre et Marie Curie* (UPMC, Paris Sorbone, France).

My PhD thesis has been supervised by Thomas HÃ©lie between 2012 and 2016 in the Sound Analysis/Synthesis team at IRCAM laboratory (STMS, UMR CNRS 9912, Paris, France). The subject is *Modeling, simulation, code generation and correction of multi-physical audio systems, with an approach by network of components and a port-hamiltonian formulation*.
