The pypHs library is developed in python 2.7 langage. It has been successfully tested with the anaconda distribution (python 2.7) available `here <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ with latest versions for all modules (december 15, 2015).
Both the library and the dictionary have to be placed in the same folder. Only the pypHs.py module should be loaded in the main python script.
